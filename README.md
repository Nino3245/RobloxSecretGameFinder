# RobloxSecretGameFinder
Can be used to find the games in a Universe ID, and the Universe ID a game is in, in Roblox

# Explanation
Roblox uses Game ID's to classify games, viewable in the URL, as you can see below,<br />
[image here]<br />
However, multiple places can occupy the same "universe", basically, it can be used to hide<br />
specific event/other related places, for example, Build A Boat For Treasure contains these:<br />
Build A Boat For Treasure (ID: 537413528)<br />
The Secret Place (ID: 1930665568)<br />
Inner Cloud (ID: 1930863474)<br />
Winter Place (ID: 1930866268)<br />
<br />
These are specific event places, for special events, most of the time, they aren't joinable without directly<br />
joining them using console arguments, so you'll just have to settle for knowing they exist,

# How to use
First, you need Python (any version, preferrably newer) and a breif understanding of it,
<br />
For finding the universe ID of a place:
Run this in your console:<br />
```python placeid.py [your place id]```<br />
It should then spit out a universe ID which you can use in the next step,
<br />
Finding the places inside a universe ID:
Run this in your console:
```python universeid.py [your universe id]```<br />
It should then spit out all places in a specific universe,
